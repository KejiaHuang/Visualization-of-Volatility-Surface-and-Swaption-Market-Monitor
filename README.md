# Visualization-of-Volatility-Surface-and-Swaption-Market-Monitor

Final project for master degree. 

Spend 4 days per week with best teammate Libo Duan for a whole semester. 

This is the best project we have ever done and imagined.

It almost includes all of the most important parts we learn in two yearsï¼š

Reading paper, Bloomberg, R, Shiny,ggplot2, Stochastic Calculus, Algorithm trading, Swaption, Latex, even use SAS when do the data cleaning(though not use in final)......

I have learned a lot from Libo and advisor Dr. Ionut Florescu.
